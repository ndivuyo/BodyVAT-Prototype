# BodyVAT-Prototype

Software for a prototype of a Vibroacoustic Therapy (VAT) vibrational body suit that uses independent channel speakers to vibrate the user.

the render.cpp files is what runs on the Bela, it is the code for the sine oscillators. The rest of the files are for the Max/MSP patch to control the sine oscillators. Reach out to me for further instructions!
